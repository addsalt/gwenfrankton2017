        <section class="about">
            <p>I am an eco-artist, a chronicler of the natural world. I believe making art that calls forth the viewer’s deepest memories connected with water, land, sky, and forest is my highest calling.</p>
            <p>After receiving my BFA, I lived and worked for many years in the Canadian Arctic. My artic paintings focused on the microcosmic world of the tundra underfoot, that place of tiny beauties. Now, as a resident of both Ontario and Nova Scotia I am interested in trees and water and especially borderlands – the liminal zone that is the water’s edge, the forest-field ecotone – places that shift and change and are neither one thing nor the other.</p>
